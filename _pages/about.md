Hi, my name is Rival, and I am a .NET developer. I try to learn new technologies, tools, approaches and experiment with code in my free time. In this blog, I talk about the results of my research. I will be happy if these articles help you learn something new or give you some interesting ideas. 

I understand that my solutions may not be the most optimal or contain errors, so I caution you not to use them in production without some testing. If you'd like to discuss any articles, ask questions, or know better solutions, you can find me on twitter [@rafaelldi](https://twitter.com/rafaelldi/). If you find any errors, please let me know about them. Thanks for stopping by my blog.
